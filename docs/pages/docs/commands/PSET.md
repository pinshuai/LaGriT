# PSET (Point Set) #

Associate a name with a point set based on various geometric and logical operators. Manipulate point sets. Output point sets.
 
By convention, *`ifirst,ilast,istride`* syntax represents a set selection defined either by a set of points from ifirst to ilast, with increments of istride (1 by default). A set selection can also be defined with **pset,get,** *pset_name* where *pset_name* has been defined by the following **pset** commands. Most commands with the syntax *ifirst,ilast,istride* can also use **pset,get,** *pset_name*.
 
 
## SYNTAX ##
 
 <pre>
 <b>pset</b>/ pset_name / select_type / select_type_options
 </pre>
 
 
The following are definitions for select_type and the select_type_options:

 
**`attribute`** forms a pset from all points in ifirst,ilast,istride which have the specified value for a node based
  attribute. If the optional comparator field is given; that operation is used to compare the attribute value to the requested value. *This option was previously named* **zq.** in old releases.
  <pre>
  <b>pset</b>/pset_name/ attribute_name / ifirst,ilast,istride / [<b>eq</b> or <b>ne</b> or <b>lt</b> or <b>gt</b> ] / [value]
  <b>pset</b>/pset_name/ attribute_name / ifirst,ilast,istride / [value] / [<b>eq</b> or <b>ne</b> or <b>lt</b> or <b>gt</b> ]
  </pre>


**`constraints`** forms a pset of nodes having the specified number of constraints.  The node's **icr** value is used as an index to the **icontab** attribute which gives the number of constraints.  [See chapter III, A](../meshobject.md) for an explanation of the **icontab** entries.



**`delete`** deletes a previously defined pset
<pre>
<b>pset</b>/pset_name/ <b>delete</b>
</pre>

**`eltset`** forms a pset of nodes in the element set named.
<pre>
<b>pset</b>/pset_name/ <b>eltset</b> / element_set_name
</pre>


**`geom`** / shape_type / forms a pset from all points inside a geometric shape as defined in the following options:
<pre>
<b>pset</b>/pset_name/<b>geom / xyz</b> /ifirst,ilast,istride/ xl,yl,zl / xu,yu,zu/ xcen,ycen,zcen

<b>pset</b>/pset_name/ <b>geom / rtz</b> /ifirst,ilast,istride/ r1,t1,z1 / r2,t2,z2/ xcen,ycen,zcen

<b>pset</b>/pset_name/ <b>geom / rtp</b> /ifirst,ilast,istride/ r1,t1,p1 / r2/t2/p2/ xcen,ycen,zcen
</pre>

-  **xyz** forms a pset from all points inside a box whose corners are xl,yl,zl and xu,yu,zu relative to the geometry center at xc,yc,zc.

-  **rtz** forms a pset of nodes within the cylinder or cylindrical shell given by radius r1 to r2, angle theta t1 to t2 and height z1 to z2.

-  **rtp** forms a pset of nodes within the sphere, sperical shell or sperical section given by radius r1 to r2, and angles theta t1 to t2 and angles phi p1 to p2.  [See chapter II, A. Conventions](../conventions.md) for an explanation of angles theta and phi.
    

**`list`** lists nodes in a pset or names of all psets for the mesh object.
<pre>
<b>pset</b>/pset_name/ <b>list</b> </pre>


logical operations **`union`**, **`inter`** and **`not`** act on previously defined psets.  The definition of the unary operator **`not`** is extended such that **`not`**/p1/p2 means p1 and (not(p2)).
<pre>
<b>pset</b>/pset_name/ <b>union</b> or <b>inter</b> or <b>not</b> / pset1[  ,pset2, … psetn ]
</pre>


**`region`** or **`mregion`** will return all nodes
  that are in the specified region/mregion - the definition of the
  region/mregion is evaluated to determine membership.  Hence the
  result may vary from what would be returned if the 'imt1' value of
  the nodes had been queried using the **attribute** option
<pre>
<b>pset</b>/pset_name/<b>region</b> or <b>mregion</b> / region_name / ifirst,ilast,istride
</pre>


 **`seq`** forms a pset of the nodes defined by ifirst, ilast, istride;
the special syntax,: 1,0,0 refers to all nodes and 0,0,0 refers to the last set of nodes created.
<pre>
<b>pset</b>/pset_name/ <b>seq</b> /ifirst,ilast,istride
</pre>


**`surface`** identifies nodes on the specified surface as indicated by defining surface_name.  The following keywords for surface_name can be used:
<pre>
<b>pset</b>/pset_name/ <b>surface</b> / surface_name / [ifirst,ilast,istride]
</pre>

  - **-all-** will identify nodes on all and any surfaces.

  - **-interface-** will identify all nodes on interfaces.

  - **-boundary-** will idendify nodes on external boundary surfaces.
   


 **`write`** write pset node list to a file, options are:
<pre>
  <b>pset</b>/ [pset_name or <b>-all-</b>] / <b>write</b> / file_name[.vertexset] / [<b>ascii</b> or <b>binary</b>]
 </pre>

 **`zone`** or **`zonn`** write pset node list to a file (FEHM Flow and Transport code zone file format). By default the zone_number is a number 1-n where n is the number of psets defined in the mesh object. Specify a number value for a single zone file with the zone_number option. 
<pre>
 <b>pset</b> / [name or <b>-all-</b>] / <b>zone</b> or <b>zonn</b> / file_name[.zone or .zonn] / [<b>ascii</b>] [zone_number]
 </pre>


Note the old **`zq`** syntax has been replaced with the current <b>pset</b>/pset_name/ syntax:

<pre>
  <b>pset</b>/pset_name / attribute_name/ ifirst,ilast,istride / [value] / [<b>eq</b> or <b>ne</b> or <b>lt</b> or <b>gt</b> ]
  
  replaces:
  <b>zq</b> / attribute_name / ifirst,ilast,istride / [value] / [<b>eq</b> or <b>ne</b> or <b>lt</b> or <b>gt</b> ]
  </pre>
